# Overview


The purpose of this project is to create a simple forum or discussion board for people that will allow people to go in, create a user account, log into the forum with said account, and then contribute to a discussion board.  My goal was to learn how to, as a software engineer, create such a functioning forum.  To operate the server and use the site, you must follow the directions given in the beginning of the sever.py file, running the python server.py command after moving to the simple_forum repository.  You must then open the correct address, again listed in the server.py file, in a browser in order to interact with the forum.

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

My web pages include a kind of home page which allows you to choose between a couple options of logging in or signing up, which take the user to each of those respective pages.  Once a person has logged in, they are then taken to the forum page from which they are able to contribute their thoughts or comments.

# Development Environment

I ended up using VScode to edit and create my files in, and I used both python and html for this project.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Item 1: I could definitely pretty everything up a little bit, but I was much more worried about functionality with this project.
* Item 2: There does seem to be an issue with the log out button, it gives me the error code 404 not found, and if I were to use this forum or wanted to refine it, I would want to address it.
* Item 3 I would probably create some sort of admin account that can edit or delete other accounts' permissions.
